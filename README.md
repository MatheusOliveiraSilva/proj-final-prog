# 🤖 Chat with Documents - Intelligent AI System

## 📖 About the Project

This is an advanced artificial intelligence system that lets you ask natural-language questions about uploaded documents, using state-of-the-art technologies such as OpenAI, Pinecone, LangChain, and LangGraph.

### 🎯 What the System Does

- 📄 Document Upload: Upload PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and text files
- 🧠 Intelligent Processing: Automatically extracts and analyzes document content
- 💬 Natural Chat: Chat with your documents as if talking to a subject-matter expert
- 🔍 Semantic Search: Finds relevant information even if you do not use the exact words
- 🎭 Multiple Conversations: Each conversation maintains its own context and documents

### 🔄 How the System Works

1. 📤 Document Upload:
   - The user uploads a file (PDF, Word, etc.)
   - The system automatically detects the type and extracts content
   - The text is split into intelligent chunks
   - Each chunk becomes an embedding (a mathematical vector)
   - Embeddings are stored in Pinecone with metadata

2. 💬 AI Chat:
   - The user asks a question
   - The system converts the question into an embedding
   - It searches for similar chunks in Pinecone
   - The AI analyzes the relevant chunks and the question
   - It generates a contextualized, natural response

3. 🧠 Intelligent Agent:
   - Uses LangGraph to orchestrate the flow
   - OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language processing
   - Specialized tools for document search
   - Isolated context per conversation (thread_id)

## 🚀 Complete Installation (For Beginners)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

1. Python 3.12+ - [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. UV (modern Python package manager) - [Installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### 📥 1. Download the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MatheusOliveiraSilva/proj-final-prog
cd proj-final-prog
```

### ⚙️ 2. Set Up the Backend (Python Server)

```bash
# Enter the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies with UV (faster than pip)
uv pip install -e .

# Go back to the project root
cd ..
```

### 🎨 3. Set Up the Frontend (Interface)

The frontend repository is [here](https://github.com/MatheusOliveiraSilva/ChatWithDocs-Front). Follow its README instructions.

### 🔑 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the `backend/` folder with the following content:

```bash
# Open your favorite text editor and create backend/.env
# Paste the content that I will send separately
```

Important: I will send the API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY, etc.) separately to Professor Clarisse for security reasons. Paste them into the `.env` file you created.

### ▶️ 5. Run the System

#### Terminal 1 - Backend (API):
```bash
cd backend
uv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Terminal 2 - Frontend (Interface):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 🌐 6. Access the System

- User interface: http://localhost:5173
- API (documentation): http://localhost:8000/docs

## 📖 How to Use the System

### 1. 📤 Upload Documents
- Open the web interface
- Click "Upload Document"
- Select your files (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
- Wait for automatic processing

### 2. 💬 Ask Questions
- Type your question in the chat box
- Questions can be about any content in the documents
- Examples:
  - "What is the summary of the AI document?"
  - "What are the main conclusions of the research?"
  - "Find information about machine learning"

### 3. 🎯 Tips for Better Results
- Be specific: "Which performance metrics were mentioned?" is better than "How is the performance?"
- Use context: "In the chapter on neural networks, which algorithm is recommended?"
- Ask about relationships: "What is the relationship between concepts X and Y in the document?"
